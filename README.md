## Nojo

Nojo is an extremely basic Hoon REPL, written in the nockapp stack. Nojo means Not Dojo.

Nojo was written to satisfy my own curiosity about the components of the nockapp stack. Maybe it can be educational for others as a basic tutorial example.

Nojo is very slow and has none of the niceties you've come to expect from a real shell. If you need a real Hoon REPL you should probably just use Urbit.

### Install & Run

You need `cargo` and `hoonc` installed. Get `hoonc` from the [nockchain repo](https://github.com/zorp-corp/nockchain)

Then just `make`
